# fischinger-portfolio
“Collection of four Java and Python projects covering OOP, data structures, algorithms, APIs, GUIs, REST services, file handling, and logic.
Purpose
The goal of this repository is to present a collection of compact, focused projects that highlight my foundational programming skills across multiple technologies and domains.
It serves as a personal portfolio for learning, showcasing, and future development.
