# Language Detection
A Python application that detects the language of a given text input. The project demonstrates text processing, API interaction, and clean program structure. It includes both a local detection module and a lightweight REST‑less server for handling detection requests without relying on a traditional REST framework.

## Features
Language identification based on word patterns:  
The program analyzes text using predefined word lists to determine the most likely language.

API‑based detection:
The application exposes a simple API endpoint that allows external clients to send text and receive the detected language in response.

REST‑less server implementation: 
Instead of using a full REST framework, the project includes a minimalistic server built with Python’s standard libraries.
This keeps the project lightweight while still enabling API‑style communication.

Modular structure:
Clear separation between detection logic, server logic, and input handling.

## Purpose
This project demonstrates how to build a lightweight language detection system, expose it through a simple API, and implement server functionality without relying on external frameworks. It highlights practical problem‑solving, clean architecture, and efficient use of Python’s built‑in capabilities.
