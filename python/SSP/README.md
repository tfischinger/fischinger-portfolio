# Rock‑Paper‑Scissors
A simple and interactive Python application that lets users play the classic Rock‑Paper‑Scissors game against the computer. The project demonstrates clean program structure, basic game logic, and user‑friendly console interaction.

## Features
Classic Rock‑Paper‑Scissors gameplay: 
Users choose between rock, paper, or scissors and play against a computer‑generated move.

Randomized computer decisions:
The computer selects its move using Python’s random module, ensuring unpredictable outcomes.

Clear win/lose/draw evaluation:
The game compares both moves and determines the result based on standard rules.

Input validation:
Ensures that only valid moves are accepted and prevents invalid input from crashing the game.

Simple and readable structure:
Ideal for demonstrating basic logic, control flow, and user interaction in Python.

## Technologies & Concepts
Python

Random number generation

Conditional logic

Console‑based interaction

Basic game loop

## Purpose
This project showcases fundamental programming concepts such as branching, randomness, and user input handling. It serves as a compact example of clean logic and structured Python code.
